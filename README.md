## Installing the BTB Content Pack

Back To Basics is a bundle containing multiple data pack modules, as well as a resource pack. Installation is fairly simple.

### For Vanilla (Per-save installation)

1. Open the folder for the game save you wish to use the pack with.
2. Drag the "datapacks" and "resources.zip" files into the save's directory.
    * You can put "resources.zip" into your resorcepacks folder if you prefer, but you will need to enable it upon loading the game.
3. If you are asked if you want to overwrite any files, click yes.
4. Launch the world you wish to use. If the game is already running you will need to press F3+T to reload all resources once the save has loaded.

### For Fabric (Universal installation)

1. Install the Fabric modloader.
2. Make sure you have the Datapack Loader mod in your mods folder.
3. Drag the "datapacks" folder into your .minecraft folder.
4. Drag the "resources.zip" file into your resourcepacks folder.
5. Launch Minecraft and enable "resources.zip" in the Resource Packs tab.
6. Create or launch a world. If the game is already running you will need to press F3+T to reload all resources once the save has loaded.
